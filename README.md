## Setup Instructions for API Key

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API. To get your own API key:

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your API key.
2. Create a `config.js` file in the project directory to store your API key:
   ```javascript
   const apikey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
   export { apikey };
   ```

3. Make sure your `.gitignore` includes `config.js` to keep your API key private:
   ```bash
   config.js
   ```
